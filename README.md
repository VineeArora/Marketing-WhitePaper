Thank you for being here and showing your interest in our project! 

Angeliz and I created this document as one of our projects for the Marketing Analyst course by WBS Code School. The objective of this exercise is to learn the concepts/principles and implement them with our thoughts using marketing tool - Whitepaper

As a marketer, we need to get through the maze of information everywhere and present it in the simplest forms of communication. It is vital to understand the psychology of people who use our services, obtain their data, and depict it most simplistically. In this whitepaper, 8 key elements have been described to consider while designing an  **effective landing page**  based on design principles and psychological concepts.

I hope you enjoy it and get many conversions on your Landing Page as possible.
